Faith (iman) breaks into six concepts,
1. Belief in the existence and oneness of God (Allah).
2. Belief in the existence of angels.
3. Belief in the existence of the books of which God is the author: the Quran (revealed to Muhammad), the Gospel (revealed to Jesus), the Torah (revealed to Moses), and Psalms (revealed to David).
4. Belief in the existence of all Prophets: Muhammad being the last of them, Jesus the penultimate, and others sent before them.
5. Belief in the existence of the Day of Judgment: in that day, humanity will be divided into two groups: that of paradise and that of hell. These groups are themselves composed of subgroups.
6. Belief in the existence of God's predestination, whether it involves good or bad.
